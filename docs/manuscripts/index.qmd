## What is a Quarto Manuscript?

Quarto provides a framework for writing and publishing your scholarly articles. You can write your article content in a format you already use (`.ipynb` or `.qmd`), and can easily include computations, entire computational notebooks, data or other resources. Quarto produces a manuscript website for you that includes a HTML version of your article, additional formats for your article, like PDF and Word documents, rendered versions of computational notebooks, and an archive of all of this content suitable for submission to a journal.

On this page, you'll get an overview of what a Quarto manuscript is. If you're ready to try it out yourself, get started with the tutorial at [Tutorial:]().

## Manuscript Output

You can see an example of Quarto's manuscript output at the website generated from our template repository at <https://cwickham.github.io/manuscript-template/>.

The template is a version of the [Notebooks Now! Quarto Lite example](https://notebooks-now.github.io/submission-quarto-lite/) simplified for this tutorial. While the template demonstrates many of the features of Quarto, if you'd like to see them in a more realistic article structure you might explore the original version.

The article itself appears as the content of the webpage, and can include all the elements common to scholarly writing like figures, tables, equations, cross references and citations.

Other Formats

:   These links allow a reader to download alternative formats of your article. In this example, there is a Word version that may be useful for a reviewer to provide feedback, and a PDF version that uses the American Geophysical Union's (AGU) template. Additionally, there is a MECA archive, a zip file that is designed to capture your article and its supporting documents into a single file suitable for sending to a publisher. You can read more about MECA archives in ADD LINK.

Notebooks

:   These links take a reader to rendered versions of notebooks included in your manuscript project. In this example, "Data Screening" is a notebook included in the project but not directly used in the article. If your article has computations in it directly, a link will be provided to a notebook version of the article itself. If your article embeds output, like a figure or table, from another notebook, that notebook will also appear here. When a reader visits any of these notebook links, they see an HTML version of the notebook allowing them to view the code and output without leaving their browser. In addition, a link to download the notebook source is also provided.

## Manuscript Source

As an author you produce the manuscript source that Quarto uses to produce the manuscript output. At its simplest, a Quarto manuscript project has two files:

-   A notebook file where you write your article. This file contains:
    -   document metadata including things like article front matter (authors, affiliations etc.) and Quarto options,
    -   the article body, written using special Quarto markdown syntax that allows you to add things like cross references and citations, and
    -   optionally, code, where you control if, or how, the code and its output appear in the article.
-   A configuration file `_quarto.yml` that identifies the project as a Quarto manuscript and controls how your manuscript is put together.

A manuscript project will often contain other files: some that add additional resources to the manuscript itself like figures, notebooks or bibliographic data; and some that are specific to manuscript workflow like Git or GitHub settings.

## Manuscript Workflow

The process of writing a Quarto manuscript involves editing the manuscript source, using Quarto to preview the manuscript output, and publishing the output to the web. If you're ready to try out this workflow yourself, continue reading to Get Started with the tutorial.
