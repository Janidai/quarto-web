title: "Publishing Quarto Manuscripts"
---

## Overview

We've set up the template repo to include most of the scaffolding needed to publish your manuscript to your repositories GitHub Pages site.  Publishing your manuscript website is as simple as pushing your changes to your repo.

## GitHub Settings

One setting to change: Settings > Actions > General > Workflow Permissions Check "Read and Write Permissions".

## Publishing

You've been previewing your work, but makes sense to render one last time.

```{.bash filename = "Terminal"}
quarto render
```

How does `render` differ to `preview`?

Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
