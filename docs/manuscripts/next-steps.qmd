title: "Manuscript Next Steps"
---


* Controlling manuscript settings in `_quarto.yml`

* Doing computations in the article itself

* Adding notebooks to a manuscript:
  - Adding notebooks that aren't used in article content
  - Embedding outputs from a notebook in article content
  - Adding reproducible notebooks: adding other files (e.g. data), capturing the evaluation environment

* Converting an existing notebook, or project, to a manuscript. E.g. add `_quarto.yml`

* Starting from scratch, e.g. `quarto create` -> `project` -> `manuscript`. Connect to GitHub

* Adding other journal templates to a project
