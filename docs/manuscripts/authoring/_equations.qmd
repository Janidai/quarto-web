Quarto markdown can include equations specified in LaTeX notation. Use single dollar signs (`$`) to add an equation inline or double dollar signs (`$$`) to add a display equation. Both of these are illustrated in this paragraph in {{< meta article-file >}}:

``` markdown
Let $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution:

$$
p(x)=\frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x}}{x !}
$$ {#eq-poisson}

Where $\lambda$ is the rate of eruptions per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of an eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated.
```
Notice that you can cross reference a display equation by adding a label in curly braces after the closing `$$`.

When rendered, this displays as:
