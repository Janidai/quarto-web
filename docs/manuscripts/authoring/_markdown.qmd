{{< include _markdown-table.qmd >}}

If you want to see more syntax, this table is a subset of the features described in the Quarto documentation of [Markdown Basics](/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html). 

As an example, the markdown to create the heading for the article's introduction is:

```markdown
## Introduction
```

First level headings are reserved for the article title, so you'll use second level and higher headings to structure the sections in your article.
