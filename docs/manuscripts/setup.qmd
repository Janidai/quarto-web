## Overview

In this tutorial, we'll show you how write an academic manuscript with Quarto in Jupyter Lab. You'll learn how to:

* Preview, render and publish your manuscript using the Quarto command line tools.

* Add scholarly front matter to describe your article.

* Add things like figures, tables, cross references and citations with Quarto specific markdown.

* Control how Quarto produces your manuscript by changing options in `_quarto.yml`.

### Is this tutorial for me?

We will assume you:

-   are comfortable using Jupyter Lab to edit `.ipynb` notebooks,
-   have a GitHub account,
-   are comfortable using git to manage local projects (e.g. you can stage and commit changes), and GitHub as a remote repository (e.g. you can clone repos from GitHub and push your changes to GitHub), and
-   are comfortable navigating your file system, and executing commands in a Terminal.

## Requirements

Before you start, you'll need complete the three steps described on this page:

1. Install Quarto

2. Install the Jupyter Lab Quarto Extension

3. Clone the Template Repository

Once you're set up, you'll be ready to []().

## Install Quarto

::: {.g-col-lg-9 .g-col-12}
::: {.content-visible when-profile="rc"}
{{< include ../download/_download-pre.md >}}
:::

::: {.content-visible unless-profile="rc"}
{{< include ../download/_download.md >}}
:::
:::

## Install the Jupyter Lab Quarto Extension

{{< include /docs/tools/_jupyter-lab-extension-install.qmd >}}

## Clone the Template Repository {#clone-repo}

To follow this tutorial you'll need your own copy of the [template repository](https://github.com/cwickham/manuscript-template).

1.  Head to [GitHub to create a new repository from the template](https://github.com/cwickham/manuscript-template/generate). Provide a "Repository Name" and make sure you check the box "Include all branches". Then "Create repository from template". ![](images/github-create-from-template.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of GitHub's create a new repo from a template page. Repository name has been filled with manuscript-template, and the box labelled Include all branches is checked."}

2.  Once your repository is created clone it to your local computer. You can do this any way you are comfortable, but for instance in the Terminal, it might look like:

    ``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
    git clone https://github.com/cwickham/manuscript-tutorial.git
    ```

    Where you use your own user name and repo name.

3.  You'll be working inside this directory throughout the tutorial, so if you are ready to proceed, navigate inside the directory, and start Jupyter Lab:

    ``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
    cd manuscript-tutorial
    jupyter lab
    ```

    ADD SCREENSHOT of Jupyterlab open with files pane open showing driectory structure.
